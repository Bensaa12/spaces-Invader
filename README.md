### Using GitHub Actions for Deployment

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically deploys the game to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch.

To use this workflow:

1. Make sure your repository has GitHub Pages enabled in the Settings
2. The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
3. Any push to the main branch will trigger a deployment
4. You can also manually trigger a deployment from the Actions tab

## Supabase Setup

### 1. Set up Supabase

1. Create a Supabase account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Once your project is created, go to the SQL Editor
4. Run the following SQL to create the leaderboard table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE leaderboard (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  score INTEGER NOT NULL,
  level INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create an index for faster queries
CREATE INDEX leaderboard_score_idx ON leaderboard (score DESC);

-- Set up Row Level Security (RLS)
ALTER TABLE leaderboard ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create a policy that allows anyone to insert
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous inserts" ON leaderboard
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

-- Create a policy that allows anyone to select
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous reads" ON leaderboard
  FOR SELECT USING (true);
```

5. Go to the "Settings" > "API" section in your Supabase dashboard
6. Copy your "Project URL" and "anon public" key

### 2. Configure the Game

1. Open the `sketch.js` file
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials:

```javascript
const SUPABASE_URL = 'your-project-url';
const SUPABASE_KEY = 'your-anon-key';
```

## Privacy Note

The leaderboard stores email addresses to identify players. Email addresses are partially masked when displayed on the leaderboard to protect privacy.
